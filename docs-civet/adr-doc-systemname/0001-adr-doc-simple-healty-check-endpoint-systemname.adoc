= [ADR-0001] Simple Health Check Endpoint

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Tegar Imansyah
* Date: 2020-08-11

== Summary

=== Issue

We need a way to determine whether our REST API server is able to accept
request or not.

=== Decision

The REST API server must have an endpoint `/health`, lower case without
any prefix, that returns HTTP code 200. The content is not important
yet.

=== Consequences

The health check endpoint will be periodically tested by central
monitoring tools and load balancer. If returns 200, it means the REST
API server is running, but doesnâ€™t mean all features is available. Else
if returns 4xx or 5xx it means the server has a problem(s).

== References, Implementations and Notes

Notes:

Normally, the health check endpoint should perform various checks, such
as:

* Connection to the backing system (Db, cache, 3rd party service)
* Host condition (disk usage, RAM usage, CPU usage)
* Application specific logic
* Latency an

But for the sake of simplicity, we should start with enabling the
endpoint and the check decision will follow later.
